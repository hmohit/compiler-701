For all of the tests other than
    replace
    space
    tst-params
there should be only "easy" nodes for the stacking phase (and all ranges
should be colored).  For the three tests above, my version is NOT able
to color all nodes (so if you're not implementing spilling, your code
should give an error message and quit when applied to replace, space,
or tst-params).
